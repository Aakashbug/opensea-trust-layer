# Project Objectives & Scope
## OpenSea Trust Layer

---

## 1. Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an
AI-powered Web3 reputation and trust infrastructure that evaluates the
credibility of wallets and NFT collections.

The key objectives are:

1. To analyze on-chain wallet behavior using blockchain data.
2. To compute a trust score (0–100) based on historical activity.
3. To identify risky behaviors such as wash trading and rug pull signals.
4. To store reputation data on-chain using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs).
5. To present trust insights through a user-friendly marketplace interface.
6. To demonstrate integration of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain.

## 2. Scope of the Project

The scope defines the boundaries within which the system operates.

### 2.1 In-Scope Features
- Wallet transaction analysis
- AI-based trust score computation
- Risk classification (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
- NFT collection credibility analysis
- On-chain reputation storage (SBT)
- Web dashboard for visualization

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope Features
- Real-world identity verification (KYC)
- Legal enforcement mechanisms
- Financial guarantees or insurance
- Complete decentralization of AI training

## 3. Academic Scope (Final Year Project)

For academic evaluation, the project scope is limited to:

- Single blockchain network (Ethereum / Polygon)
- Basic AI models and rule-based logic
- Limited dataset for experimentation
- Local or testnet deployment
- Demonstration-focused UI
- Emphasis on correctness and clarity

This scope ensures feasibility within time and academic constraints.

## 4. Startup Scope (Industry Expansion)

As a startup product, the system can be expanded to include:

- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon)
- Advanced AI models and graph-based learning
- Real-time data ingestion
- Zero-knowledge privacy proofs
- Public APIs for marketplace integration
- Monetization through SaaS and API usage

## 5. Scope Difference Summary

| Aspect | Academic Scope | Startup Scope |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Data Size | Limited | Large-scale |
| AI Complexity | Basic | Advanced |
| Deployment | Testnet | Mainnet |
| Users | Evaluators | Real customers |
| Revenue | None | Monetized |
