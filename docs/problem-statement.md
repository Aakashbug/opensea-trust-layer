# Problem Statement
## OpenSea Trust Layer – AI-Powered Web3 Reputation System

---

## 1. Background

The rapid growth of Web3 and NFT marketplaces has introduced a major
challenge: **lack of trust in decentralized ecosystems**.

Most Web3 platforms allow users to interact anonymously, which, while
preserving decentralization, removes accountability and credibility.
As a result, users frequently fall victim to scams, fake NFT projects,
rug pulls, and wash trading.

---

## 2. Existing Challenges

### 2.1 No Wallet Reputation
- Wallets have no historical credibility score
- New and malicious wallets appear identical to genuine users

### 2.2 High NFT Fraud
- Fake NFT collections
- Rug pulls after mint
- Artificial trading volume (wash trading)

### 2.3 Platform-Centric Trust
- Trust decisions are controlled by centralized marketplaces
- Reputation is not portable across platforms

### 2.4 Lack of Predictive Risk Detection
- Current systems detect fraud only after losses occur
- No AI-driven early warning mechanisms exist

---

## 3. Problem Statement

There is no standardized, decentralized, and intelligent system in Web3
that can evaluate wallet behavior, assess NFT project credibility, and
provide real-time trust and risk signals across platforms.

This absence of a trust infrastructure results in:
- Financial losses for users
- Reduced adoption of Web3 technologies
- Lack of accountability in decentralized marketplaces

---

## 4. Proposed Solution

The OpenSea Trust Layer proposes an **AI-powered Web3 reputation
infrastructure** that analyzes on-chain behavior and assigns
verifiable trust scores to wallets and NFT collections.

The system:
- Uses AI to analyze historical blockchain data
- Predicts risky behavior before fraud occurs
- Stores reputation on-chain using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)
- Provides trust data via APIs to marketplaces

## 5. Use Case Explanation

### Use Case 1: Wallet Trust Evaluation
When a user connects a wallet to an NFT marketplace, the system:
- Analyzes transaction history
- Computes a trust score (0–100)
- Displays credibility to other users

### Use Case 2: NFT Collection Risk Detection
Before minting or buying an NFT:
- The system evaluates creator history
- Detects abnormal minting or trading behavior
- Displays a risk indicator (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

### Use Case 3: Marketplace Trust Integration
NFT marketplaces can integrate the Trust Layer API to:
- Filter low-trust wallets
- Highlight verified creators
- Warn users about high-risk projects

### Use Case 4: DAO & Governance Trust (Future Scope)
DAOs can use wallet reputation to:
- Weight voting power
- Prevent governance manipulation
- Encourage long-term participation
