# OpenSea Trust Layer  
### AI-Powered Web3 Reputation & Trust Infrastructure

## Overview
OpenSea Trust Layer is an AI-driven Web3 reputation system that assigns
verifiable trust scores to wallets, NFT collections, and creators to
reduce fraud, rug pulls, and wash trading in decentralized marketplaces.

This project is designed as:
- A **Final Year Engineering Project**
- A **Startup-grade Web3 Infrastructure Product**

---

## Problem Statement
Web3 platforms lack a standardized, cross-platform trust and reputation
mechanism. Users are forced to trust anonymous wallets without historical
credibility, leading to scams and market manipulation.

---

## Solution
An AI-powered trust layer that:
- Analyzes on-chain behavior using machine learning
- Generates reputation scores and risk signals
- Stores reputation on-chain using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)
- Integrates with NFT marketplaces via APIs

---
